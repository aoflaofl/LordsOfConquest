# LordsOfConquest
Disassembling the C64 version of Lords Of Conquest.

I want to understand 6502 coding better and I'll start by disassembling this
game.

For this, I'll be using some tools:
-   [Regenerator 1.7](http://csdb.dk/release/index.php?id=149429)
-   [Infiltrator Disassembler V1.0](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=100129)

Neither of these is very user friendly.  I'll try to remember to make notes
here as I use them.
